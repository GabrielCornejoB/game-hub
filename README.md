# **Game hub**

Web application based on Code With Mosh React 18 Intermediate course that consumes the rawg.io API to display videogames. You can check it up at: [GameHub](https://6-game-hub.vercel.app/).

It was developed using the following tools:

- **React.js** - As the frontend library
- **TypeScript** - Bc everyone loves type safety
- **ChakraUI** - UI component library
- **Axios** - Data fetching
- **React Query** - Global state management
- **Zustand** - Local state management
- **React router dom** - Routing

_and other stuff you can check in the package.json_

## **Features**

Game hub includes some advanced (I think they are advanced haha) features that helped me learn a lot about React, some of these are:

- REST API and data fetching using a generic API client.
- Parametrized queries.
- Filtering by Genre, Platform & Sort order.
- Search by name.
- Loading skeletons.
- Pagination & Infinite scroll.
- Handle mutations.
- Caching.
- Optimistic updates.
- Global & local state.
- Dynamic routing.
- Responsive design.
- And a lot more...

## **Good practices**

React is a un-opionated library, so good practices change depending on the project or the developer. I am no expert on good practices, but for this project I tried to follow:

- SOLID Principles
- Suggested naming conventions for React
- Feature-based file structure
- And some other stuff that i've heard from podcasts that talk about Clean code.
